# Titanic Survival Prediction

Welcome! This project is done under Encryptix. This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare. This is a classic beginner project that involves data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.
