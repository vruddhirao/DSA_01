# Titanic Survival Prediction

Welcome! This project is done under Encryptix. This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare. This is a classic beginner project that involves data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle. It contains information about individual passengers, including:

Age
Gender
Ticket class
Fare
Cabin
Whether or not they survived
